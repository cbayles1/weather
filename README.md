# My New Weather App

This weather app demo can give you the weather details and forecast of any given location.
All it needs is: 
- A country code (_US_ for example)
- A zip code (_10282_ for example)

## Resources
This project uses a few different resources, as my goal with this project was to get a handle on how to use such tools.

- Next.js - for the basic structure of the app and to easier use React functionalities
- OpenWeather OneCall API - for grabbing weather data of a location
- OpenWeather Geocoding API - for translating zip codes into coordinates
- Vercel - for project deployment (view the finished product [here](https://weather-cbayles1.vercel.app/))
